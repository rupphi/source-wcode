# Znack session-scoped signing resume

## Objective

Prevent persisted Znack purchase/introduction pipelines from repeatedly opening the CryptoPro certificate or token dialog after WCode starts, while preserving automatic continuation for work that the user started during the current app session.

## Approved behavior

- A pipeline created by a user action in the current process is authorized to request signatures for the rest of that process. It remains authorized if the user switches to another shop.
- A pipeline restored from SQLite after app startup may continue steps that do not need a new signature. At the first signing boundary it waits without invoking CryptoPro.
- Selecting a shop from the shop dropdown is explicit session authorization for that shop. Waiting restored pipelines for that shop resume in the background.
- Restoring the last selected shop during startup is not explicit authorization and must not trigger signing.
- Authorization and waiting state are in memory only. No database migration or persisted consent flag is introduced.
- If CryptoPro reports cancellation, missing token/certificate, unavailable private key, or an expired certificate, automatic signing retries stop for that pipeline. Its existing order, downloaded KIZ, document, and idempotency state remain unchanged and retryable.
- An already-submitted ambiguous mutation is still reconciled or polled through the existing pipeline stages; the change must not submit duplicate purchases or introduction documents.

## Technical approach

- Java 25, JavaFX, Maven, SQLite; no new dependency.
- Add a thread-safe session signing gate keyed by `shopId:pipelineId`.
- Execute every coordinator advance inside a pipeline context. A guarded signature provider checks that context immediately before CryptoPro is invoked.
- Mark newly enqueued pipelines and explicit introduction retries as authorized.
- Mark a pipeline as waiting when signing lacks session authorization or CryptoPro returns a human-action error. The poll scheduler does not reschedule a waiting pipeline.
- Explicit shop selection authorizes the shop, clears its in-memory waits, and invokes persisted pipeline resume on the existing background executor.
- Suppress the shop dropdown callback while its items/initial value are populated so startup restoration cannot masquerade as a user selection.

## Code boundaries

- Signing policy belongs to `integration/znack`; JavaFX only reports explicit shop selection.
- Existing Znack pipeline stages and database schema remain unchanged.
- Existing Ozon/WB order, KIZ, finance, and release behavior is out of scope.
- Existing user changes in the working tree are preserved.

## Testing strategy

- Unit-test the signing gate: recovered pipeline is deferred without invoking the delegate; current-session pipeline remains allowed; explicit shop activation releases recovered work; human-action CryptoPro errors enter waiting state.
- Coordinator regression-test that a waiting-for-signature pipeline is not scheduled repeatedly and is rescheduled after explicit shop activation/resume.
- Header regression-test programmatic population versus a real user selection where practical without relying on timing.
- Run targeted Znack tests, the full Maven test suite, package build, and `git diff --check`.

## Success criteria

- Closing the CryptoPro dialog cannot cause the same background pipeline to reopen it every 30 seconds.
- New purchases keep progressing after changing the selected shop.
- Old work resumes signing only after the user deliberately selects its shop.
- No paid KIZ, pipeline, order, or document state is deleted or duplicated.
